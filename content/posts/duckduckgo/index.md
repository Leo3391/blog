Everyone uses Google to search things, but I prefer DuckDuckGo
Why?
Because it has a strong focus on privacy, and it has some interesting things:

## Themes
DuckDuckGo has its own terminal theme that Google doesn't have! Look at this:

## DuckDuckGo in the terminal
What search engine can work in a terminal? DuckDuckGo!  
DuckDuckGo in `w3m` on Termux:

## Clearing (fire) data and tabs
Both DuckDuckGo and Google can clear data, but DuckDuckGo has its cool fire animation!

Of course because why not! It is definely the best search engine!
