Everyone uses Google to search things, but I prefer DuckDuckGo
Why?
Because it has a strong focus on privacy, and it has some interesting things:

## Themes
DuckDuckGo has its own terminal theme that Google doesn't have! Look at this:

## DuckDuckGo in the terminal
What search engine can work in a terminal? DuckDuckGo!
