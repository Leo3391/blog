# A Stupid Minesweeper Game written in Python
I made my minesweeper in Python. It's really stupid. I'm even too lazy to add `try-except` to handle Exceptions.  
Check it out here: [Minesweeper on GitHub](https://github.com/Leo3391/Minesweeper)

Status:  
`[x]`: unrevealed  
`[1]` to `[8]`: mines around  
`[  ]`: blank/no mines around  

[a, b]: row=a, cols=b  
`1 2`: reveal [1, 2]  
`3 5f` or `3 5 f`: flag/unflag [3,5]
